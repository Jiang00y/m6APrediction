\title{One-hot encode DNA sequences into nucleotide position factors}
\usage{
dna_encoding(dna_strings)
}
\arguments{
\item{dna_strings}{A character vector of DNA sequences of equal length.
Each string should contain only the characters \code{"A"}, \code{"T"},
\code{"C"}, and \code{"G"}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with one column per nucleotide position
(\code{nt_pos1}, \code{nt_pos2}, ...). Each column is a factor with
levels \code{c("A", "T", "C", "G")}. The number of rows equals
\code{length(dna_strings)}.
}
\description{
Converts a character vector of fixed-length DNA strings into a data frame
where each column corresponds to a nucleotide position (e.g. \code{nt_pos1}
to \code{nt_pos5}). Each position is stored as a factor with levels
\code{c("A", "T", "C", "G")}, which is suitable for use in machine learning
models such as random forests.
}
\examples{
dna_encoding(c("ATCGA", "GGACA"))
}
